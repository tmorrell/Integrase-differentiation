# Integrase-differentiation

[![DOI](https://data.caltech.edu/badge/181994133.svg)](https://data.caltech.edu/badge/latestdoi/181994133)

This repository contains descriptions of systems of ODEs used to model circuits using integrase-mediated differentiation for improving function of burdensome synthetic circuits, Jupyter notebooks for modeling these architectures with comparison to naive inducible production, and analysis of experimental results. Modeling and data are describe in the biorxiv submission "Tunable integrase mediated differentiation facilitates improved output of burdensome functions" : https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/614529v1. Flow cytometry data used in the analysis and generation of figures can be found in CaltechDATA: https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1228.
